## Overview
A custom phase extension allowing Bazel users to compile Scala source code using the [Zinc compiler](https://github.com/sbt/zinc). To learn what "customizable phases" are and how the phase architecture can help your Bazel project, see [this doc on customizable phases](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_scala/blob/master/docs/customizable_phase.md) on the [bazelbuild/rules_scala](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_scala) project.

This project is aimed at anyone who depends on the bazelbuild/rules_scala project but would like to swap out the default XXX compiler with Zinc compiler. This is especially helpful for developers or companies whose codebases have large Bazel targets -- if Bazel targets are not granular enough, builds can take a long time. Because Zinc is an incremental compiler, it can lead to significant performance increases. However, be aware that Zinc also adds non-determinism to your builds.

## Files included

The `rules` directory contains definitions and implementations of the Zinc compiler phase. `rules/phases/phase_zinc_compile.bzl` defines the logic of how the phase works. `rules/ext/phase_zinc_compile_ext.bzl` wraps the phase definition together with some extra attributes and defines how it will be implemented.

The `test` directory contains Scala source code to test functionality of the phase.

The `scripts` directory contains shell scripts to run these tests. Run `scripts/travis.sh` to execute all tests.
